Interactive web-based simulations to visualize and explore fundamental concepts in quantum mechanics. Perfect for students, educators, and enthusiasts who want to see quantum behavior in action.

Projects
**1. Quantum Universe Simulator**

Simulates key quantum phenomena in an interactive particle system:

Superposition: Particles exist in multiple states until measured.

Collapse (Measurement): Click a particle to force it into a definite state.

Entanglement: Linked particles collapse together, illustrating quantum correlations.

Interference: Particle trails show wave-like interference patterns.

Purpose: Make abstract quantum concepts visible and easy to understand.



**2. Split-Path Superposition Lab**

Simulates a quantum particle traveling two paths until measurement, inspired by the double-slit experiment:

Superposition: Ghost particles move along both paths, weighted by probability.

Collapse (Measurement): Measuring the particle collapses it into one path; the other fades.

Prediction & Feedback: Users can guess the outcome and get instant feedback.

Classical vs Quantum Mode: Compare deterministic behavior with true quantum probabilistic collapse.

Purpose: Teach quantum randomness, probability, and measurement visually and interactively.
